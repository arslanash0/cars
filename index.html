            <h1>Famous expensive cars</h1>
            <p>The most expensive cars in the world are much more than transportation. These rolling art pieces
                encapsulates the priorities of the one percent, and in that universe, these are truly mind-boggling
                machines. The most expensive cars sold in public auto auctions through the traditional bidding process,
                that of those that attracted headline grabbing publicity, mainly for the high price their new owners
                have paid.
                On May 5, 2022, in a secret auction at the brand's museum in Germany, Mercedes-Benz sold one of just two
                1955 300 SLR Uhlenhaut coupes from its extensive collection of historical automobiles—which dates back
                to the earliest days of the car in the late 19th century. The sale, to a private buyer, was for 135
                million euros ($142,769,250). It handily outstripped the previous record-setting $48.4-million sale of a
                1962 Ferrari 250 GTO at a 2018 auction to become the most expensive car ever sold at auction. Both of
                these high-dollar sales were brokered by RM Sotheby's.
                On June 1, 2018, it was announced that a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO had sold for $70 million at a private
                auction, at the time a world record.

            <h3>1.Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita</h3>
            <img src="Images/1234.jpg" alt="Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita">
            <p>Underneath the lustrous finish lies a 4.8-liter, dual-supercharged V8 with a total output of 1,004 hp and
                797 lb-ft, which means it should have little to no trouble overtaking semis on the freeway. The cars
                specifications — in both performance and price — are nearly comical at this point, and just three were
                ever made. </p>
            <p>Alex Todd Brand Manager at BoxyMo commented "The 1931 Bugatti Royale Kellner Coupe was sold for $8.7
                million in 1987. That and many others wont be included in this list, they are no longer available in the
                market."</p>

            <h3>2.Lamborghini Veneno</h3>
            <img src="Images/lamb.PNG" alt="Lamborghini Veneno">
            <p>The car is absolutely stunning from every angle, and to this day, were not convinced it isnt an alien
                spacecraft surveying our planet for eventual takeover. It just doesnt seem real. The only thing more
                remarkable than the look is the price — a whopping $4.5 million.</p>

            <h3>3.W Motors Lykan Hypersport</h3>
            <img src="Images/motors.PNG" alt="W Motors Lykan Hypersport">
            <p> You may recall the Lykan Hypersport from its starring role in the blockbuster Furious 7, where the
                Lebanese supercar crashed through not one, not two, but three skyscrapers in Dubai. In a franchise
                filled with high-end exotics and one-off custom creations, the fact that the Hypersport got so much
                focus is a testament to its magnetism.</p>

            <h3>4.Mansory Vivere Bugatti Veyron </h3>
            <img src="Images/mansory.PNG" alt="Mansory Vivere Bugatti Veyron ">
            <p>This list wouldnt be complete without some version of the mighty Bugatti Veyron. Were shining our
                spotlight on the the Mansory Vivere edition here, because not only is it one of the fastest cars in the
                world, its one of the most expensive.</p>
